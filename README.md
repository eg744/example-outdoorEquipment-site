I wanted to practice basic but attractive webpage design, improve my CSS skills and dabble with some design patterns. I'm more comfortable with CSS than I was but I have much more to learn about design. I certainly respect talented designers, making functional and beautiful websites is a wonderful intersection of artistry and technical skill.
